I'm going to update oh I'm going to do it again here the codes here from the 2020 business three now

because they updated on January 16, 2023 that right this one month they updated and now

it's a little more difficult to pass So now I have to teach you how to get the

codes so when I have the first code I'll come back with you I'm here on the side of the first

code which is my code you have to go there at the end to find yours my code

is 2255 So let's go there now just wait for this wall to leave here so I can put the code

and when this wall leaves here I'll come back with you I've already got it here now that the wall

it's already out now we're going to put the code that is 2 2 5 5 enter now guys in this one right here you're

going to do what you're going to just have there and there guys in this thing here

to jump here to see your code Remembering that in this

one also the codes are not the same they are not the same for everyone

guys i'll be here with you now let's jump here again and see my code again

see my new code i didn't even see my code

841 reminding you guys again that my codes are not the same as yours ok, I just go

there and put the 8411 for example yours It could be 3586 so the codes are very different from each

other ok let's see here eight guys it was here the code now inside here the code is

And then you have to be and it's going to come here this one just wait for it to turn green so you can

find the code that goes on this side of the room I don't know if it's already stopped here the wall is

on this side of the room when it turns green no when it turns red you'll find out

how 2 4 6 9 yours will be different OK mine is 2469 let me come here 2 4
